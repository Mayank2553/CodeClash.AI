## CodeClash.AI

Welcome to CodeClash.AI, an AI-powered coding and learning platform designed to help students and developers practice programming while gaining deep conceptual understanding through context-aware Generative AI assistance.

Unlike traditional coding platforms that focus only on problem-solving, CodeClash.AI integrates AI-driven editorials and an intelligent chatbot directly inside the code editor, transforming coding practice into a guided learning experience.

⸻

### Architecture

CodeClash.AI follows a modern, scalable client–server architecture with seamless AI integration:
	•	Frontend: A responsive, component-driven web application built using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by the Monaco Editor (VS Code editor) for an industry-grade coding experience.
	•	Backend: A robust RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js, responsible for authentication, problem management, code execution handling, and AI orchestration.
	•	AI Layer: Integrated with Gemini AI API to provide:
	  •	AI Learn editorials (step-by-step explanations & solutions)
	  •	Context-aware AI chatbot for real-time doubt resolution
	  •	Intelligent analysis based on problem + user code context
	•	Database: MongoDB Atlas is used for secure, scalable storage of users, problems, submissions, and AI interaction history.

### Key Features
	•	🧠 AI Learn – Generates editorials, approaches, and optimized solutions using GenAI
	•	💬 AI Chatbot – Ask contextual questions about code and logic in real time
	•	🧑‍💻 Monaco Code Editor – VS Code–like in-browser coding experience
	•	🔐 JWT Authentication – Secure user login and protected routes
	•	📊 Progress Tracking – Stores submissions, results, and learning history
	•	🌐 Fully Web-Based – No extra software or hardware required
