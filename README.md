# CodeClash

Welcome to CodeClash, a competitive programming platform designed to help you hone your coding skills.

## Architecture

This project follows a modern client-server architecture:

*   **Frontend**: A responsive user interface built with **React** and styled with modern CSS. It is bootstrapped with **Vite** for a fast development experience.
*   **Backend**: A robust RESTful API powered by **Node.js** and **Express**. It handles business logic, user management, and problem data.

## Project Structure

-   [**`/frontend`**](./frontend/README.md): Contains the React frontend application.
-   [**`/Backend`**](./Backend/README.md): Contains the Node.js backend server.
-   [**`/Backend/API_DOCS.md`**](./Backend/API_DOCS.md): Detailed API endpoint documentation.

## Project Status

*As of August 2025*

The project has been successfully initialized and the foundational structure is in place.

### Completed
- ✅ **Project Scaffolding**: Initial setup for both frontend (React/Vite) and backend (Node/Express).
- ✅ **Version Control**: Git repository initialized with a `main`/`develop` branching strategy.
- ✅ **Initial Documentation**: Core `README.md` files and API documentation templates have been created.
- ✅ **Task Management**: Project management guidelines established.

### In Progress
- ⏳ **User Authentication**: Building the API endpoints and frontend components for user registration and login.
- ⏳ **Problem Schema**: Defining the database structure for coding problems.

### Next Steps
- 📝 **Problem List**: Develop the UI to display the list of coding problems.
- 📝 **Code Editor**: Implement the code editor component for solving problems.
- 📝 **Submission System**: Build the backend logic to handle code submissions.# CodeClash.AI
